What is happening in the background?

The keyboard presses go to electrical signals, into IO to the processor, processor is running a browser GUI that 
somehow translates the search string into a request to Google, goes through a TCP/IP packet out the Wifi chip to 
the local Wifi hotspot, then through switches, firewalls, internet service provider, internet backbone, received 
by Google servers (or multiple servers, that all race to respond ASAP), the results may already have been cached,
then data is sent back over the same route to one's computer, displayed on the screen.
